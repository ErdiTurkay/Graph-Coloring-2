# This project was written in Java using JDK1.8 in IntelliJ IDEA.
When you run the main method of Main.java, it asks you for the input file name. This file should be where sample1.txt, sample2.txt and sample3.txt are.<br>
After the file is named, it creates an "output.txt" file that gives the optimal solution to the same location according to the contents of the file.<br>
With Verifier, it can be checked that the input and output files match.
